            Соң-Көл,[2] IPA: [sóɴkœl], also Соңкөл Songköl,[3] literally
            "following lake", Russian: Сон-Куль, romanized: Son-Kul',[4] also
            Сонкёль Sonkyol'[5]) is an alpine lake in northern Naryn Region,
            Kyrgyzstan. It lies at an altitude of 3016 m,[6] and has an area of
            about 270 km2 and volume of 2.64 km3. The lake's maximum length is
            29 km, breadth about 18 km, and the deepest point is 13.2 m. It is
            the second largest lake in Kyrgyzstan after Issyk-Kul, and the
            largest fresh water lake in Kyrgyzstan. Geography High altitude
            Song-Köl belongs to the Naryn river basin. The lake sits in the
            central part of Song-Köl Valley surrounded by Songköl Too ridge from
            the north, and Borbor Alabas and Moldo Too mountains from the south.
            Hydrologically, the Song-Köl basin is characterized by poorly
            developed surface stream flows, and substantial subsurface flow.
            Four perennial rivers - Kumbel, Aktash, Tashdöbö, and Karakeche -
            disgorge themselves into the lake. In the south-east, the structural
            high is cut through by the river Kajyrty (in its upper course also
            called Song-Köl) that flows into the Naryn.[3][7] Environment
            Climate The mean temperature in the lake basin is −3.5 °C (25.7 °F)
            with mean temperature of −20 °C (−4 °F) in January, and 11 °C (52
            °F) in July. Annual precipitation averages 300–400 mm from April to
            October, and 100–150 mm from November to March. Snow cover in the
            lake basin persists for 180 to 200 days a year. In winter the lake
            surface freezes, the ice becoming as much as 1-1.2 m thick. The ice
            on the Song-Köl begins to thaw in the middle or at the end of April,
            and completely disappears by late May.[8][9] Ecology In 2011,
            Song-Köl was designated by Kyrgyzstan as its third Wetland of
            International Importance for the Ramsar List.[10] Since 1998, a
            section of the lake and its shore (3,400 ha land, 5,200 ha water) is
            protected as part of the Karatal-Japyryk Nature Reserve.[11] History
            There are several signs of nomadic life from the earlier times in
            the Son Kul valley. Ancient petroglyphs can be found east from the
            lake and there are round stone settings that have similarities with
            the ones found in Mongolia and Altai area. Several different sized
            burial mounds can be also found around the lake.[12].

            <span class="first-character ny"></span>Sary Chelek Lake is some
            1873 meters (6,145 feet) above sea level, and is 7.5 km (4.66 miles)
            long. Sary Chelek varies in width, from 350 m (1,150 feet) to 1,500
            m (4,920 feet), and at its deepest point reaches a depth of 234 m
            (768 feet), making it the second deepest lake in Kyrgyzstan. The
            shoreline is deeply indented and lined by steep forested slopes,
            which descend into the depths of the lake. Shallow areas have
            developed only in the larger of the bays. The water level changes
            with the seasons, with a variation of about 65 cm (25 in). The lake
            is fed by the Sary Chelek River, various streams, and underground
            thermal vents. The outflow forms the Tus-Kaul River. The waters
            often appear a shade of greenish-blue, which makes for attractive
            photographs. There is some dispute as to how Sary Chelek was formed
            - some scholars think it resulted from the collapse of two ridges of
            mountains, which blocked the river and held back the waters, while
            other think it was the result of a shift along a fault line some
            2,000 years ago. The name Sary Chelek means “yellow bucket”. There
            is a legend that a beekeeper attending his hives on the lake shore
            was pouring honey into a bucket and was so taken by the color of the
            honey that he decided to name the lake yellow bucket. There are
            other people who think that the lake derives its name from the fact
            that in the autumn, when all the leaves of the trees turn colors,
            the whole basin reminds visitors of a yellow bucket.

          <p class="margin-top-10">
            It is only possible to access Sary Chelek from the north or south.
            From the north there is a trekking route over the mountains from
            Talas, which crosses high mountain passes and deep canyons. From the
            south, there is a road almost to the lake shore from the village of
            Arkyt, about 20 km away. There are some small lakes to the
            southeast, such as Kyla-Kol, Iyri-Kol, Aram-Kol, Cherek-Kol, and
            Bakay-Kol, but Sary Chelek is regarded as the gem, the jewel in the
            crown. Generally, the climate at Sary Chelek is damper and milder
            than the rest of Kyrgyzstan. The high mountain ridges around the
            lake protect the reserve from the cold northerly winds in the
            winter, so the temperature here is much higher than elsewhere in the
            valleys, though it can fall to -27° C (-17° F) in the winter. Snow
            cover can be fairly uneven, with the southern slopes sometimes
            having no snow but other areas covered in a meter or more, and can
            last for over 100 days. In May and June the weather can be humid,
            but in the later summer it is warm, dry and windless. Some fishing
            is permitted in the rivers feeding the lake, but not in the lake
            itself. Swimming was banned after fatal casualties in 1983. Hunting
            is absolutely prohibited in the reserve.

      <section>
        <div class="block">
          <p>
            <span class="first-character atw"></span>There are two waterfalls
            named Arslanbob in Kyrgyzstan. Only one is Big, and the second is
            Small. Both are located near the village of Arstanbap, Jalal-Abad
            region. This is a mountainous area with a subalpine climate. A Big
            waterfall located in the area of the Babash-Ata mountain range is so
            named because of the height of 80 meters. Due to the fact that it is
            very narrow, it seems that the waterfall is even longer. The name of
            the waterfall is translated from Kyrgyz as "lion's mouth", because
            when the water falls, a sound similar to a lion's roar occurs. It
            will not work to come close to the waterfall, because its waters
            fall into the abyss. Near the Big Arslanbob there is a Holy lake and
            the tomb of Ibn Abbas. It should be borne in mind that you can only
            get to the waterfall on foot or on horseback. Also note that the
            road to the waterfall will take about two hours. The height of the
            Small Arslanbob is about 30 meters. It is very picturesque and is
            surrounded by trees. You can walk to it through the narrow streets
            leading from the village. At the foot of the waterfall, which is
            wide enough, it is especially beautiful. A tree grows nearby, on the
            branches of which it is customary to tie ribbons or scraps of fabric
            and make wishes. Due to the fact that it is easy to get here, there
            is almost always a queue near Maly Arslanbob. Therefore, if you want
            to enjoy the picturesque views without strangers, you need to come
            early in the morning. Not far from Small Arslanbob is the Kyrk
            Cherten cave (forty angels). According to legend, there lived a
            woman who helped people. Residents believe that mysterious forces
            live there today.

            There are also relict walnut forests in the village of Arstanbap and
            in the neighboring tract. Some trees, according to local residents,
            are more than 10 centuries old. The area of walnut forests is more
            than 600 thousand hectares. The Kyrgyz walnut forest is considered
            the largest in the world. About 1,500 tons of nuts and 5,000
            thousand tons of other fruit trees are harvested here every year. In
            the 1930s, a North American striped raccoon was brought here, which
            took root in these latitudes and began to breed. The village of
            Arstanbap is a resort. There are a lot of tourists here in summer.
            The village is located in the mountains – at an altitude of 1700
            meters above sea level. In addition to hiking to waterfalls, locals
            will offer you to learn horse riding, ride jeeps and motorcycles in
            the mountains. There are few sights in the village, but people come
            here for the mausoleum of Arstanbap-Ata with unique carved walnut
            doors created in the XV century. Please note that conservative
            Muslims and many elders (the oldest residents) live in Arstanbap, so
            we recommend dressing modestly.
